Bus Station Application 
This is a simple java swing application that simulates a Bus Station Application where users can book trips.
These Trips are saved in text Files.
Managers and Employees can log into this application as admins.
Employees information is stored in text files too.
Code by Fatma Sherif (me) and my Partner for this project Rowan Khaled.
To log in as an admin enter username "ADMIN" and password: 123
To Log in as a user you can use username 4701 and pass 1234
For more user names and passwords, they are saved in a text file called members
